<!-- 
Postodc researcher of artificial intelligence at the University of Alberta. His research interests include Deep Learning, Synthetic Data, Industry 4.0, and Probabilistic Graphical Models. -->
<div style:"text-align: justify;">

Living in Canada since 2015, I obtained my  Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Regina in 2020. My undergrad experience was in Industrial Engineering at one of the best universities in Brazil. My graduate research focused on *(i)* probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks and join tree propagation and *(ii)* deep learning models, including sum-product networks. I have published 24 peer-reviewed papers, including one paper at AAAI-2019. **Currently, working as a postdoc researcher at the University of Alberta.**

Please, see my resume for more details.
